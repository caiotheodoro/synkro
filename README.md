# AI-Fueled Supply Chain Optimization Platform

## Summary
A multi-tenant supply chain platform founded on AI, connecting manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers. Based on real-time analytics, predictive AI, and multi-protocol messaging, the platform optimizes logistics, reduces costs, and improves demand prediction.

## Primary Features
- **AI-Based Demand Forecasting**: Machine learning predicts optimal inventory levels from historic data
- **Real-Time Inventory Management**: Go-based service synchronizes real-time warehouses and suppliers
- **Multi-Protocol APIs**: REST for web apps, gRPC for internal microservices, WebSockets for real-time updates
- **Order Fulfillment Automation**: Rust microservice decides routes with AI
- **Event-Driven Processing**: RabbitMQ for reliable order processing and async processes
- **Multi-Tenant SaaS**: Suppliers, retailers, and logistics operators have customized dashboards

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Microfrontend Architecture)
- **Vue.js**: Supplier & Retailer Dashboards
- **Next.js**: Admin Panel, Authentication, SEO-Friendly Landing
- **GraphQL**: Apollo Federation for centralized API Gateway

### Backend Microservices

| Service | Technology | Purpose |
|---------|------------|----------|
| API Gateway & Auth | TypeScript (NestJS/Fastify) | Handles REST, GraphQL, and WebSockets for real-time updates |
| Logistics Engine | Rust (Axum/Actix-Web) | Order fulfillment, routing, and optimization algorithms for high performance |
| Real-Time Inventory Sync | Go (gRPC + Gin) | Handles inventory synchronization between warehouses via gRPC |
| AI/ML Predictions | Python (FastAPI) | Machine learning-based demand forecasting (TensorFlow, Pandas) |
| Notification Service | Bun | Handles real-time notifications and alerts |

### Communication Layer
- **RabbitMQ**: Async tasks, notifications, and event-driven order processing
- **gRPC**: Optimized inter-service communication (Go & Rust services)
- **REST + WebSockets**: Public and live tracking APIs for shipments

### Data Storage
- **PostgreSQL**: User & order management (ACID-compliant)
- **MongoDB**: Elastic document store (inventory, tracking information)
- **Redis**: Cache of real-time order statuses
- **MinIO/S3**: Invoice storage, documents of shipment

### Observability Stack
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana for service metrics (API response time, load balancing)
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logs
- **Tracing**: Jaeger / OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing of microservices
