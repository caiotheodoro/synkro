# Order Creation Fix

## Issue Identified:

The `create_order` function in the Logistics Engine is only creating the main order record but is not creating:
1. The order items
2. The payment information
3. The shipping information

This leads to incomplete orders in the database.

## Solution:

Implement a transactional approach that ensures all related records are created atomically. The main changes include:

1. Enhance the `OrderService` to:
   - Use a database transaction
   - Create order items within the transaction
   - Create payment info within the transaction
   - Create shipping info within the transaction

2. Add transaction-aware methods to repositories:
   - `create_with_transaction` in OrderRepository
   - `create_with_transaction` in PaymentRepository
   - `create_with_transaction` in ShippingRepository

3. Modify OrderService constructor to accept database pool parameter

## Key Implementation Details:

1. The order creation process now follows these steps:
   - Begin database transaction
   - Create main order record
   - Create all order items
   - Create payment information with the correct order ID
   - Create shipping information with the correct order ID
   - Commit transaction

2. Error handling:
   - If any part fails, the entire transaction is rolled back
   - The inventory check is still performed before starting the database work

3. Data consistency:
   - All related records will have the correct order ID
   - The database transaction ensures atomicity

## Testing:

To verify this fix:

1. Create an order using the same data as previously attempted
2. Check the database to ensure:
   - Order record exists
   - Order items are created
   - Payment information is created
   - Shipping information is created
3. Validate that all records have matching order ID values
